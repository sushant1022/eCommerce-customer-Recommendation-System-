    "- Have you ever wondered how an e-commerce platform comes with suggestions that you need? You might have seen ads popping up on your social media accounts related to the searches you have made. This all is done through the customer recommendation system.\r\n",
    "You can develop your very own customer recommendation system. To start with, you can use your browsing history. Both behavioral data and implicit data is required. There is considerable scope for recommendation system developers in the tech world. If you crack this and learn how to upskill the way to come up with a better version of the E-commerce customer recommendation system, then there is a better chance for you to end up having a career in a renowned company."
